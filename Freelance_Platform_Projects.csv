We are looking to create two websites that are similar and different at the same time. 

The first site is designed for drivers who wish to join our taxi company to put their details and upload their credentials, insurances, licenses etc. What am looking for in the design of this website is an element of interactivity. For example the landing page would welcome the driver, and ask him for his first name, then when the driver inputs the name they press next, and it asks them for their last name, and so on. Every page that comes after that will ask for a required information for registration. For example it will ask for their vehicle make and model, it will ask to upload their picture, and so on. I hope I explained myself very well. We do have an active domain we would like to use, also this website must work in the same way on mobile as well as desktop. 
All the uploaded information should come to our email for us to process. 

The second website is different, as it is for a sister company that deals in crypto. We want the same style of page design where the customer is asked questions and according to their answers are led on to the next appropriate page. 

The premise for the second website is to trade crypto for cash. There will be an element of API to the crypto exchange to get accurate and updated prices. Also, as with the website above, the answers should be complied and send to our email to process.

Video Production Company Proposal,Design,Expert ($$$),Graphic Design,GBP,19.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-01-30 11:22:27,"We are a Video Production company who are looking to update their proposal document. 
Our current proposal was made in photoshop which although gets the job done, is time-consuming when needing to update the document to accommodate the next project/client. 
We are looking for someone to produce a new design within Adobe Indesign which is eye-catching, yet simple and clear. The template needs to be easy to update, saving us a fair amount of time in the pre-production process. 

Every page will stay the same, apart from the (How much will it cost?) page. This will be updated to suit each project. We need to be able to change the project brief and the Cost table. Not all roles will be needed, however, there will always be three columns: ROLE, QUANTITY & RATE. 
We need the cost page to be as simple and as easy to fill out as possible. 
It would be great if a new row in the cost table could be made effortlessly.
It would also be great if somehow the 'Quantity' and 'Rate' columns synced up. So that when the quantity (days) changed, the 'Rate' would update alongside it. 
This would also be great in connection to the final costs section. (All of the 'Rates' automatically add up to produce a total figure). These are all in replacement of having to change things manually. 

We aren't familiar with InDesign and simply want the quickest and easiest process to be able to change the 'How much will it cost?' page, so we have no idea if any of this is possible. 

We are open to any ideas which could help us with what we are after.

for example: We created a log file in root - and print the occurrence of duplicate which returning like below, you can see that, row_order is null even if query correctly have the values:

1) PID: 24700 buyer_id: 53 current_time:1674657417 row_order: Order Id: 65 SELECT id FROM wp_job_orders WHERE pid = 24700 AND uid = 53 AND date_made = 1674657417

This is a new project, starting with a small amount of work in this first phase. However, it has the potential to grow into a long-term project of several hours per week for the right candidates. In this initial phase of the project, the majority of time and energy is spent in the audio and video editing process, not the voice recording.

We prefer to work with friendly, reliable people who have a love of life and an element of life and animation in their voices (in other words, not flat and monotonous voices). The team of people involved in this project all have these characteristics in common.


No previous experience is needed.

Flexibility to do the work at any time of the day or night within a defined period of 24 to 48 hours.


Tasks:

Recording yourself speaking words and phrases in Spanish for videos. Audio editing and production not required (this will be done later by someone else)


Requirements:

- Clear speaking and enunciation

- A microphone of reasonably good audio quality

- No background noise

- Must be able to start today. There is a set of recordings that will happen this week and then more will follow after",,2023-01-29,Tbilisi,Georgia,USD,

The voice artist would have to save each dialogue in one wav-file, so he/she would be sending 100 files to us  (you don't have to save every single sentence in a separate file, we'll do the splitting ourselves later on). 

Between the various ""speaking parts"" (one speaking part sometimes comprises more than one sentence) the voice artist needs to make a pause of about 2 seconds, so our technician can then split the various sentences more easily. 

Since we offer this content in many different languages and we need to be able to align each single sentence with its counterpart in another language, it's important that the above-referenced pause is kept during the recordings in order to facilitate our file splitting. 

The complete length of the recordings will be around 1.5 hours.

This is a fixed price offer. Please only bid if you agree to this price. We do not accept any request for a change of price once the order has been placed.

The word count is roughly 15,000 words, although we'd like to reiterate that we go by the time of the recording (see above).

The sentences should be read with a natural diction, but not too fast (please listen to the enclosed samples of the male voice artist).

I am looking for someone who can design an original collage of pictures that would be inspired by the pictures that I have attached.

The entire picture collage will need to be approximately 19x15 (19 inches length, 15 inches width) and I plan on framing it. I do not need each individual picture to be the exact same length and width as the others, but I do need the final product to be rectangular (once again, 19x15).  The main color theme needs to be blue and white (similar to the color of my wallpaper in the picture attached, but it does not need to be the exact same). Other colors are more than welcome to be used if your creative instincts say to do so.

I need your assistance with an online sales web-based site for people to enter a dancing (Acrobatics) competition.

The hope is to have a complete set-up website (can be Shopify) from around 1 February to 1 April.
People must be able to enter the competition from the site and give all the details, such as:
1. Name of Participant
2. Surname of Participant
3. Club Name
4. Date of birth
5. Contact email
6. Then they must be able to choose from the example of the different sections under six years – Novice Duet.
7. Each participant must pay the once-off registration fee and can then enter as many events as possible
8. There are also duets and larger groups. 
9. Each item has a title and must have the name of the participant or a duet or group space for the terms of the people in a group (max 10)
10. Each type of entry has a different price
11. All participants pay a once-off registration fee.
12. Pupils must be able to upload their music. In other words: When they enter the item, they must upload the music they will use. When they upload more than one item, they must also be able to upload the music for each item. We must then be able to ""download"" all the music they will use. We will need your input on how to link the music to the item they entered. 
13. The people must fill a cart with their registration fee and the items they want to enter and then pay, linked to one of the payment providers. 
14. They must see their ""entry"" receipt with an entry number.
15. From the back end, we must see all the person's entry details and have a link with their uploaded music. There must also be a link/place where they can upload their music if they don't have it ready when they enter. 
16. Entry can only be 'valid' after payment.
17. The site's overall feel must be ""happy"", professional and organised – we have a logo etc. A professional look is important
18. I will need to know that the person helping has done this type of work before and would need examples of their work.
19. The work offered must be better than what I can do for myself on Shopify.

I have tried using FacetWP and would like to extend this plug in if possible. However, I would be willing to code the whole filter bar from scratch with tutoring/explanation of the code.

Look forward to connecting.

Hi! My name is Peter and I have Youtube channel with 1.3K subscribers where I post videos (1 to 2x a week) around the creator economy, self-improvement, and lifestyle topics (https://youtube.com/petersu). I'm looking to hire a long-term video editor for my Youtube channel - someone who's excited to tell fun visual stories, help people improve their lives, and who takes pride in their work. 

Ideally you’ve edited a lot of Youtube videos (talking head + vlogs), follow instructions cleanly, respond to feedback/revisions well, and use Final Cut Pro X so I can make any final changes before exporting if necessary. 

Responsibilities
My videos have ranged from 3 to 20 minutes but are usually around 8 to 10 min and your editing would include: 
–Picking good takes
-Keeping smooth pacing
-Adding tasteful text and simple motion graphics
-Picking relevant b-roll that enhances what I'm saying
-Adding music and SFX that heightens the emotion (big plus if it’s tastefully cut to the beat)
-Doing basic sound mixing like compression and EQ
-Doing light color correction and color grading
-Adding pictures/funny memes/transitions/effects occasionally
-Ideally injecting your own creative secret sauce in the mix too
Extra bonus if you can research Youtube tags/titles, and eventually upload to Youtube. 

Workflow
I'll supply you with:
-Raw footage (4K via Google Drive)
-Assets (fonts, text, graphics, access to royalty-free music libraries and stock footage)
-Comments via Frame.io

Sample links for my general style and tone:
https://youtu.be/O_PJmCrzack
https://youtu.be/MQxFtYk_VA4
https://youtu.be/oNC0g3jO7ks

Next Steps
If you're interested, please review my sample videos and reply with:
1) Why you're interested
2) Editing software you use
3) Links to your portfolio
4) Turnaround time
5) Number of revisions you can do (we’ll aim to lower this over time)
6) Estimated cost to make a video like my samples
7) Please include the word ""Purple Yoda"" in your first sentence. 
  
If there's a good fit this could be a high volume of videos for you for a long time and could potentially expand into editing podcasts and shorts as well. Thanks and I'm looking forward to chatting.

1. Create two new product attributes called x-axis and y-axis.
2. On the product page check to see if the product has values for both of these attributes.
3.If so display the multiplication table in a tab using the values
If not, do not display the tab or grid
4.When the product is bought, a comment should be added to the order stating the values of the x and y axis, if they exist

The following points apply and should always be followed.

Magento provide their own Programming Best Practices that should be followed at all times.

The code should be valid according to the coding standards Coding Standards

Code should be written in a testable manner

The code should adhere to the technical guidelines as much as possible

In addition, all PHP code should be strictly typed, strict comparisons should always be used, and unless prohibited by class contracts strict parameter and return types must be used.

Fully qualified class names should always be imported and short class names used

The completed code should run without error in all cases.

Deprecated or legacy functions denoted by Magento should not be used

Where necessary, code comments should be used

Method and class annotations should be used where necessary to describe parameters and return types

Main Requirements:

Your task is to do the following

Create two new product attributes called x-axis and y-axis
On the product page check to see if the product has values for both of these attributes
If so display the multiplication table in a tab using the values
If not, do not display the tab or grid
When the product is bought, a comment should be added to the order stating the values of the x and y axis, if they exist

To help complete the task there is a template repository that you can use. 
This will automatically run the tests that you create and preform static analysis on the code each time you push a commit. You should use this to create a private repository in github and then share that with us when complete.

Module Setup:

The module should run successfully on the latest version of Magento 2

Coding standards and guidelines should be aligned with the latest available Magento version.

All code should be placed in a module called 
NathanCommerce/MultiplicationTables

Attribute Management:

The attributes should be created using a data patch

The values should be validated to ensure that they are either
Both set as positive integers
Neither are set
If neither of these conditions are met then an error message should be displayed, and the product is not saved

Product Page:

If both attributes are present a tab will be displayed

This tab will be called Multiplication Table by default

When clicked, a multiplication table will be displayed using the values from the product

If the values are not present, or the values are invalid, then no tab will be displayed and no error will be displayed

Order Comment:

This should be handled using an event listener

The comment should only be added once

It should say $productName was ordered with these dimensions $xAxis by $yAxis

If there are multiple products in the order with the attributes, then each product should appear on a new line within a single comment

Module Configuration:

Within the Configuration menu in the admin, there will be a tab called Nathan Commerce

Within this there will be a section called Multiplication Tables

This section will contain these options
The ability to enable and disable the module. When disabled no multiplication tables should be displayed on the front end and orders should not be affected by the multiplication code when placed.

The ability to change the title of the tab on the product page

Documentation

You should create, in Markdown format as a README.md file in the root of your module, a set of instructions that cover both developer and user level documentation. * How to install it * How to configure it * How to run the tests

Basic Testing:

Unit tests should be created for parts of the code that are free of dependencies. These should cover all paths through the code under test and ensure that it gracefully handles success and failure conditions.

Integration Testing:

The module should be mainly covered with Integration Tests
Other test types can be created if useful

Fixtures should be used where appropriate.

Feel free to make use of our testing module to help with this

Tests should pass both with and without the TESTS_CLEANUP flag being set

They should confirm that the code is able to do what is asked when given the correct inputs

They should also confirm that the code is able to handle things going wrong gracefully

Additional Static Checks:

Magento ships with additional static checks alongside the Code Sniffer rules used for the coding standards. The following tools should pass using the Magento standards.

Long-term video editor for Youtube channel (1-2x per week),"Video, Photo & Image",Entry ($),Filmmaking,USD,50.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-28 02:48:17,"Background
Hi! My name is Peter and I have Youtube channel with 1.3K subscribers where I post videos (1 to 2x a week) around the creator economy, self-improvement, and lifestyle topics (https://youtube.com/petersu). I'm looking to hire a long-term video editor for my Youtube channel - someone who's excited to tell fun visual stories, help people improve their lives, and who takes pride in their work. 

Ideally you’ve edited a lot of Youtube videos (talking head + vlogs), follow instructions cleanly, respond to feedback/revisions well, and use Final Cut Pro X so I can make any final changes before exporting if necessary. 

Responsibilities
My videos have ranged from 3 to 20 minutes but are usually around 8 to 10 min and your editing would include: 
–Picking good takes
-Keeping smooth pacing
-Adding tasteful text and simple motion graphics
-Adding music and SFX that heightens the emotion (big plus if it’s tastefully cut to the beat)
-Doing basic sound mixing like compression and EQ
-Doing light color correction and color grading
-Adding pictures/funny memes/transitions/effects occasionally
-Ideally injecting your own creative secret sauce in the mix too
Extra bonus if you can research Youtube tags/titles, and eventually upload to Youtube. 

Workflow
I'll supply you with:
-Raw footage (4K via Google Drive)
-Assets (fonts, text, graphics, access to royalty-free music libraries and stock footage)
-Comments via Frame.io

Sample links for my general style and tone:
https://youtu.be/O_PJmCrzack
https://youtu.be/MQxFtYk_VA4
https://youtu.be/oNC0g3jO7ks

Next Steps
If you're interested, please review my sample videos and reply with:
1) Why you're interested
2) Editing software you use
3) Links to your portfolio
4) Turnaround time
5) Number of revisions you can do (we’ll aim to lower this over time)
6) Estimated cost to make a video like my samples
7) Please include the word ""Purple Yoda"" in your first sentence. 
  
If there's a good fit this could be a high volume of videos for you for a long time and could potentially expand into editing podcasts and shorts as well. Thanks and I'm looking forward to chatting.

Learning Outcome: describe the role of CAD/CAM in automated manufacturing

A.
1. Determine the benefits and limitations of components manufactured by forging versus machined from plate metal 
2. For a range of given components, investigate the most appropriate manufacturing methods

B.
1. Describe the selection of machining processes depending on part geometry: i.e. flat and
cylindrical geometry (e.g. the learner will understand appropriate machining processes depending on the geometrical form of the part required)
2.  Understand the impact of material removal rate on surface finish and texture as well as speed of
production (e.g. how material removal rate during conventional machining should be considered and its impact on the properties of the base material)
3. Understand  the effect of production volume (prototypes, batch, and high volume) on the selection of the appropriate process and tooling (e.g. appropriate manufacturing processes and tooling depending on the required batch size.)

C.
1 Describe the application of bonding technologies (e.g. material selection, appropriate application of bonding, e.g. welding, adhesives)
2 Describes the types and use of mechanical fastening (screwed fastenings, e.g. metric bolts, studs and set screws, self-tapping screws, locking devices; rivets, e.g. snap head, pan head and countersunk heads, bifurcated and pop rivets)
3. Understand the use of limits and fits during part to part assembly (e.g. use of limits and fits tables for typical engineering applications such as holes and shafts)
4. Evaluate how limits and fits influence fastener application (e.g. application of clearance fit fasteners vs  interference fit)
5 Evaluate how the choice of bonding process can influence the product design (the learner should investigate an application where the types of bonding has influenced the component design)

- assignment questions to test learner knowledge of above together with model answers

Secondly, I had rented out a bag to a client last year, she didn't return it and had damaged the earrings. We reached out to her as she would have to replace/repair the goods in line with our terms and conditions, however she claimed that the bag was sent back. We then decided to file a dispute through the small claims court, she then asked us for a mediation call through the courts which we then agreed to. She didn't bother turning up to this, so we proceeded to submit our witness statement and bundle. We then had to pay over £350 for the hearing fee. The court hearing took place last week, I had written to the court to inform them that I wouldn't be in attendance, however it seems that they receive that and my absence was taken negatively and the claim was struck out. FYI she didn't attend either, I would like to revisit this as she is sitting on an expensive bag and I think we were treated incredibly unfairly by the court.

My proposal of $40 contains:
- Editing the About for the channel
- Creating and Editing a description template pre-made for all the videos.
- Editing the titles on ALL the videos (I usually charge for 10 titles, but for this project, I'll do them all since you don't have extremely many videos)
- Editing tags across all the videos that you have
- Generating tags that you can use in your future videos
- Editing playlists with description and tags.
- Fully optimizing your channel with SEO
- Give you tips on the new videos (on your niche category)
- Give you COMPLETELY FREE TOOL to generate tags and see which videos are searched in the niche of ""Pakistan"" and ""Travel"". It is widely used by lots of YouTubers that know it, so this one will definitely help you now and also in the future to generate real and organic traffic by your niche.

For additional rebrending such as Design and Video, I can offer to make you:
- A really nice YouTube channel banner
- Logo for your YouTube channel
- Create a template pre-made lower-third popups that you can use in your videos to promote your YouTube/Facebook and Instagram (if you have one, which is pretty important, if not no problem)
- Video Intro for your videos OR Video Intro for your reels (intros are different, either for a normal video or reel)
- Video Outro for your videos OR Video Outro for your reels (outros are different, either for a normal video or reel)
- Watermark for your videos, in case when your videos go trending people can not STEAL your idea. It will stop that.

The visual branding opportunity has not been included in the proposal since your original job requires only SEO and optimizing and managing your YouTube channel once. Although, if you would like, I would really be happy to make all these graphic changes because they can really SKYROCKET your YouTube channel, and I usually charge 100$, which in total would be $140, but in case you are interested and I want to start the new year by doing really nice work for only certain amount of the price, I will do everything for only",,2010-09-19,Purfleet,United Kingdom,USD,Diector

You can do illustration/typography type designs or have one or two that incorporates a customers photo.

They need to ideally be done in Photoshop as that's where we print from and find it easier to change. But we can work with Illustrator files if needed. Mainly using Google fonts, but if there's a special one that's needed for the design we could sort that.

Looking for someone who has done printable designs for products in the past, personalised or not. If we really like the finished products there will be more work going forward.

Specialism: our client is a global bank, however the meetings you’ll have to attend are going to be interviews and case calls for their Employee Relations teams. 
Turnaround time: you will have 24-48 hours to complete the summary of each attended meeting
To assess your suitability for the role, could you please confirm:
1.	If you have experience with professional writing into the requested target language?
2.	If you are able to cover these meetings remotely considering the location requirement? You must be based in China\Singapore.. Does that work for you given your current location? 
Please note that Global Lingo pays minute-takers per minute of meeting and this rate comprises the effort of both attending the call + taking notes and then completing the final summary.  
Finally, please note that you will have to attend our live induction/training sessions (one for each language combo) ahead of the project start. During that session, you will also be required to take a live minute-taking test which will simulate a real-life scenario.

"""Unlock Your Imagination"" Looking for a children's illustrator",Design,Expert ($$$),Illustration & Drawing,GBP,24.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-01-26 08:44:53,"OBJECTIVE:
To create a set of playful and engaging illustrations for a new toddler and baby brand that will appeal to both children and parents.

Target Audience: Parents and caregivers of babies and toddlers (ages 0-3)

Key Message: Our brand is all about fostering creativity, imagination, and learning in young children through fun and interactive products.

There will be 2 visual styles and we can share a figma board that we started to provide some initial guidance.

**1st Visual Style**
Bright, colorful, and playful with a focus on children's themes like:

1. Pirates
2. Dinosaurs
3. Space / Planets
4. Unicorns
5. Stars
6. Zoo Animals
*not limited too

These should be easily recognizable to young children. The illustrations should be inspired by the natural world and should be engaging and interactive for children.

We are looking for a cross between:

Realistic: This style aims to depict people, animals, and objects as they appear in real life. It often uses detailed drawings and accurate colors. This style can be used for educational books for children.

Fantasy: This style is characterized by imaginative and fantastical elements such as magical creatures, enchanted landscapes, and otherworldly settings. It is often used in fairy tales, myths, and other stories that appeal to a child's sense of wonder and imagination.

**2nd Visual Style: 'Scandi Mum'**

Scandinavian mum style, often referred to as ""Scandi mum"" style, is a minimalistic and functional approach to parenting and motherhood. This style is characterized by a focus on simplicity, practicality, and comfort. It is often associated with the Nordic countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and is known for its clean lines, neutral colors, and natural materials.

Scandi mum style is often reflected in the way that mothers dress, with a focus on comfortable and functional clothing that is easy to move in. This can include items such as oversized sweaters, leggings, and practical shoes. The color palette is typically neutral, with a mix of gray, black, white, and beige tones.

The aesthetic is also reflected in the way that mothers decorate their homes, with a focus on minimalism and functionality. This often includes natural wood elements, light-colored walls, and simple, uncluttered spaces.

Scandinavian mum style is also associated with an emphasis on outdoor living and an active lifestyle. This is often reflected in the way that mothers dress their children, with a focus on practical, functional clothing that can easily be worn while playing outside.

In summary, Scandinavian mum style is a minimalist, practical and comfortable approach to parenting and motherhood, characterized by simple, natural materials, neutral colors and an active lifestyle

Tone: The illustrations should be upbeat and positive, with a focus on fun and learning. They should inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity in young children, and should encourage them to explore and discover the world around them.

Deliverables: A set of illustrations suitable for use across our range of products packaging, advertising materials, and in-store displays.

This can include illustrations of individual products, scenes featuring the products in use, and standalone illustrations that convey the brand's message and values.

Timeline: The illustrations should be completed within 4 weeks.",,2023-01-26,Riyadh,Saudi Arabia,USD,

See attached JPG for work in progress. We would like to print 3D versions for use in their retail space. I am guessing that the first stage in delivering that process is to create 3D designs. Please tell me if I am wrong. There are 30 icons in total. They will all be about 50cm x 50cm x 50cm in size (very rough dimensions for now) which I am telling you in case it is relevant. They could be bigger (1m cubed) or smaller (25cm cubed) but that is the best I can say for now. We may not do them all, we might do some of the easier ones, we might even redesign them if they don't work that well for 3D printing purposes. In fact, we might even use 3D versions on the website - in time, we might even animate them. We have already animated the 2D versions. So, the first stage in the process is to find the person we want to work with on this project from a 3D design perspective.

Right now I am looking at portfolios to select an artist - specific details will come when I have narrowed my search to 2 or 3 artists.

Work is to be done in Blender. At conclusion of each project after you have been paid, Blender application files will also be delivered to me.

Creative process: I will supply any 2D graphics as needed for references and foundational elements for creating modeling elements.

After the project is completed, I want to also arrange a series of instructional sessions to go through the process to show how the file is built from scratch (this is a separate billable item to be arranged at an agreed upon price in addition to the creative project fee - this may be done on a Zoom basis or whatever system the artist thinks would work best). For this, the artist will need to be a good and clear communicator with good organizational & people skills. 

There will most likely be a series of illustrations & animations needed. Although I am also working on getting up to speed with Blender, I may not always have time to do some of these projects myself so I am looking for someone that will be available for ongoing work.

Please send only a few specific examples of your work or a few specific links to view - I do not want to be overwhelmed with tons of content to wade through - a few good examples is all I need to get an idea of your suitability for this work (technical, simple machine rendering & animation - high quality, photo-realistic). As to level of complexity - think of a garage door that can be rendered from different angles and can be animated showing it going up and down; or, a locker opening and closing.

Pricing for this will have to wait until you have all details (sets of 2D drawings  showing front, side, top views will be supplied to give a full understanding for what is needed). Prior to project commencement, a NDA will be sent and details will follow after NDA is signed and returned to me. Additional clarification can also be via email communications, phone discussion and zoom sessions - there are also some photographic references and other visualization resources.

The price plugged in below is not relevant since PPH requires an amount to post the job, price will be determined after you have all the details and the NDA is signed.",,2014-01-15,San Antonio,United States,USD,

""Welcome. It's time for some focused and productive work. Take a moment to centre your mind, by following the breathing prompts in the circle.""

Data Research - Find UK Cyber Security Recruiters + Headhunters,"Marketing, Branding & Sales",Entry ($),Strategy & Research,GBP,80.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-25 13:00:39,"See template output deliverable attached (especially row 4 that provides ""Guidance Information""). In short, I am seeking to get the contact details of UK based Cyber Security Recruiters who focus on placing contractors (not permanent full time positions, contracts should be the focus). The details required are set out in the template attached.

Recruiters want to get contacted so finding the required information should be easy (unlike finding sales leads for industry clients who don't want to get contacted). I accept sometimes the odd data point (i.e. landline phone number isn't available for the odd person). Important notes;

- Cyber security recruiters are those who specialise in the following terms; information security, cyber security, CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) and Head of Information Security or Head of Cyber Security.
- Please also look for ""headhunters"" > these specialise particularly in finding senior contractor positions and candidates.
- Please try to find two different people per company. Ideally I want a head of team, i.e. ""Desk Lead"", or ""Head of Cyber Security Recruitment"" and then a much more junior role, i.e. ""Researcher"" or ""Cyber Recruitment Consultant"".
- Looking for HIGH QUALITY DATA > please test emails for validity using an online tool. A sample of the output will be audited and any poor or inaccurate data will be identified and not paid for.
- I have no real number of names required, however many there are that are high quality. I expect around 100-200 perhaps.
- You'll likely find it easiest/fastest to start the research by researching the companies who specialise in cyber security / information security / IT security recruitment in the UK  and then find the right people (not the other way round).
- Price: please be competitive with your quotes. The £80 price is just a placeholder and expect the winner will be able to do it for less.

If this is a successful project I will need a similar project to find EU recruiters and recruiters placing into the UAE/Middle East too. Any questions just ask!",less than 1 week,2018-12-13,London,United Kingdom,GBP,

To resolve this issue, you'll need to identify and fix the cause of the redundant Purchase events. Here are a few steps you can take:

1. Review your website's purchase flow: Make sure that the Purchase event is only firing on the final confirmation page of the checkout process and not on any other pages, such as the cart or product pages.
2. Check your Shopify settings: Go to your Shopify admin and make sure that the ""Enhanced Ecommerce"" setting is not enabled. This can cause the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
3. Check your pixel implementation: Make sure that the pixel is properly installed on your website and that it's only firing the Purchase event once per transaction. Use the Facebook Pixel Helper chrome extension to check for any errors.
4. Check for duplicate pixels: Make sure that you only have one pixel installed on your website. If you have multiple pixels, this can cause the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
5. Check for third-party apps: If you're using any third-party apps that add tracking pixels to your site, make sure that they are not firing the Purchase event multiple times.
6. Check for any scripts or codes that may fire the purchase event multiple times
 
There can be several reasons why your pixel is now firing redundant Purchase events, even though it was working correctly last month. Some possible causes include:
1. Changes to your website's purchase flow: If you've made changes to the pages or flow of your checkout process, it's possible that the Purchase event is now firing on multiple pages instead of just the final confirmation page.
2. Changes to your Shopify settings: If someone enabled the ""Enhanced Ecommerce"" setting in your Shopify admin, it could have caused the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
3. Issues with your pixel implementation: If there are any errors in the way the pixel is installed on your website, it could cause the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
4. Changes to your website's code: If you've made changes to your website's code, it's possible that you've introduced new scripts or codes that are firing the Purchase event multiple times.
5. Third-party apps: If you've recently added or removed any third-party apps that track pixels on your site, it could have caused the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
6. Caching Issues: Sometimes, if the cache of the website or browser is not cleared, the previous events might be still present and firing, even though they should have expired.

I am looking for someone to create 30 short social media posts for my company. I would like 30 posts to start and would potentially need this as an ongoing service. 
I run a recruitment company and would like to have more presence on LinkedIn. I don't post a lot on our company page so I am looking for some short written posts to boost increase our content. 
Each post should vary in length between 40-100 words.
I am open to suggestions regarding the content of the posts. We offer both a corporate recruitment service (i.e.. recruiting candidates on behalf of companies) as well as jobseeker services such as CV writing etc. I envisage most content being focused on providing tips to jobseekers or comments on the recruitment industry. 

Content must be original and not copied!
 
Example 1: 
The average time employers spend looking at your CV is just 6-7 seconds. Your CV is your first impression…make sure it counts! If you are struggling or would like some advice with your CV, please get in touch today! 

Example 2: 
Searching for a new job can be quite daunting. Your mind will start to go fuzzy looking at all the different job boards out there. Sometimes, one of the best ways to find a job, is to avoid job boards! Making a short-list of companies you would like to work for and regularly checking their career pages for new opportunities is an easy way to narrow down your search.

I am looking for someone who can create a series of graphics/cartoons/drawings and potentially some animations, for an online education course. 

The course has 5 modules and each module has a few dozen images, diagrams or pictures, which we'd like to be redone to all be in the same style and branding, perhaps using a character that can be repeated throughout the course. In addition, it would be great if we could have some gif of that character for reactions to the students' answers. 

Happy to have a quick call with the artist to explain in more detail if that helps. 

I can provide access to the course and highlight which of the pictures/diagrams we would like to be redrawn. There are probably around 200 in total but I can confirm the exact number in the next few days.

We would ideally need these all to be completed by February 5th, but we could also do them in batches i.e. the first 2 modules by Feb 5th and then subsequent modules each delivered every 3-4 weeks. 

Please specify in your proposal which deadline(s) you would be able to meet (i.e. all by 5th Feb or module by module). 

I'm including a few examples below of the images.

Human Helix,Design,Expert ($$$),3D Design,GBP,500.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-24 12:50:57,"HI

I need a high quality finished result so please apply if you feel you have a strong understanding of figurative 3D skills and the ability to work well to this brief.

What we need:
A 3D sculpture, In the shape of double helix made out of people. They should be a mix of genders and ages. Almost like a a baroque painting, cherubs and nudes. 

An important factor is that the figures need to represent African descendants. So, some with dreadlocks etc

We do not need the faces too detailed so I would love it if you can make the general form quite angular and flat so we haven't got the issue of detail making the file too large - so, a flatter, chiseled finish please.

Please make the file available for blender and 3D printable too. The maquette/model will be about 40cm tall but we may need to enlarge it in the future so please give me access to different sized files too. 

We have 3 weeks before I need this job done and i will need updates as we go.

I will attach different images to show you the type of shape of a DNA Helix - please note, the groove element that will be explained in the file - this is how the curves go in an A, B, A pattern of one large one small - look it up if u need, there are many videos on youtube. Or ask and ill send you some.

I will also attach ideas of how the figures will hold each other too.

One image is AI generated and of the figures holding hands - I like everything about this apart from how they are holding each other- I need them to be hand to foot or hand to hand, maybe to convey the bit in the middle of the DNA strand you can have a person go across it too.
Also i do not want to see a seperate helix - just the one made from the people.

I have a more simple example of how this project was done at earlier stage with just hands that i will send to you after as its a large file.

This will be an ongoing project so plenty of scope to work together more if you can smash this one for me.

The software should fully support Arabic and English language. The software provider should make certain that all modern security details have been taken into account such as email verification OTP etc. The modified vehicle r software follows the following customer journey:
A. Client since his arrival information to an event by any way he considers better for him and that is telephone, SMS, WhatsApp message, web booking form or using an app that the provider will provide.
B. The admin console operator inputs that information to the system and assigns a driver for this ride as well as a vehicle type and that could be a car run bus or truck.

Your job will be to write the CSS selectors to program a web scraper to gather data from online retailers. You can verify the selector works by running document.querySelector(SELECTOR) or document.querySelectorAll(SELECTOR) in the dev tools console. 

1. pageNumberParameter - Paste the URL parameter that determines which page of results to show, e.g. from this link ""https://www.very.co.uk/sports-leisure/mens-sports-clothing/outdoor/e/b/119443,2781.end?pageNumber=2"" you would find ?pageNumber=2 and replace the page number with $i so it becomes ?pageNumber=$i
2. acceptCookiesSelector - This one is only required if the site has a cookies popup that blocks the page. Paste the CSS selector for a button that accepts the cookies.
3. pageCountSelector - CSS selector for the button or other HTML element where the innerText is ONLY the last page number. E.g. if there are 30 pages of jeans, find an element whose only text is ""30"" - this is typically located with several page buttons that might look like 1 2 3 4 5 ... 30
4. searchPageGrid - CSS selector on the search page for the container that holds all the links to product pages.
5. searchPageOrigin - CSS selector for the a tags with hrefs linking to product pages, duplicate hrefs don't matter but try to skip any ads. Instead of running document.querySelectorAll, this will be run like searchPageGrid.querySelectorAll so sometimes this can be simple as ""a""
6. searchPageTitle - CSS selector for the product title on the search page
7. searchPagePrice - CSS selector for the CURRENT product price on the search page
8. searchPageThumbnail - CSS selector for the product thumbnail on the search page, must have a src or a data-src or a data-srcset attribute with a link to the image. Make sure it works on all the products on the page because sometimes they're lazy-loaded.
9. productTitle - CSS selector for the product title on the product page
10. price - CSS selector for the product price on the product page
11. oldPrice - CSS selector for the original product price on the product page (if it doesn't exist, leave blank, but make sure to check at least one discounted product)
12. image - CSS selector for the first product image on the product page, must have a src or a data-src or a data-srcset attribute with a link to the image
We will be running the scraper and checking that each site is scraped correctly. You will be paid for each retailer you complete so make sure there are no errors. It should take about 10 minutes per retailer. If you're unsure how to write the selectors on a site/field, move onto the next one and fill in the text box(es) with the word TODO and we'll complete those ones. Start your proposal with ""CSS Selector"" so we know you've read it all. 

We're looking for someone who can scrape 75 of these sites this week. If you do a good job on this, there may be ongoing work for you as we add more retailers.

Create  ‘Bespoke’ Chain for Handbag Straps,Design,Expert ($$$),Fashion & Clothing,GBP,250.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-23 20:12:21,"TODAY’S BRIEF …To Get Proposed Business Launched
To source,… 
T-bars 2. Chain (with unique design) and 3. Jump rings that have all already been designed and are available to buy to create a series of 16cm long pieces of chain that will have a T-bar at one end and a jump ring at the other end.

Just Like this Skull Bracelet But with Openable-Closable Jump Ring
One of the attachments shown below shows a skull bracelet that looks very much like the kind of 16cm long piece I would to have created - please note the T-bar at one end and jump ring at the other. The 16cm chain lengths will be employ to create chain-leather-chain handbag straps like the one shown in one of the attachments below. Without the need for cutting/welding, a handbag factory will attach the chains to leather straps by prying the jump rings open, threading the jump rings through eyelets on the leather straps and then closing the jump rings closed - that why the jump rings at the end of each 16cm long chain length has to be openable-closable. 

Material
Ideally, I would like these creation to look like shiny silver but be created from the kind of material usually employ to create handbag ‘hardware’. Oftentimes this is zinc alloy or brass, I think.


A Set of 4 Identical 16cm Long Unique Chain Pieces  (Times At Least 4)
For the first such unique chain that is sourced I would like four identical of such 16cm long pieces created. Then I would like to repeat that at least three more times - with three different unique chain designs. (So in total, I will end up with at least 16 pieces of the 16cm long creations.

Can You Source/Suggest Candidate Chain Design?
I would love one of the set of four 16cm chain length to created from a skull design just like the shown skull bracelet. Can you source such a chain? I would love if you could source similar chains that are made of identifiable items i .e chain made of interconnected , say, dogs, flowers, cats, other animals etc. And/or can you source chain designs that you think will help create beautiful handbags? 

Here Are My Candidate Chain Designs, ….

Site coverage with buildings should be within the range 25% to 75%, although in certain exceptional cases these parameters may be varied. Adequate provision is to be made within the sites for the loading/unloading of commercial vehicles, and to avoid the need for reversing onto the highway.
Parking provision must be made within the sites to the standards required by the local planning authority.

2.
Sites are subject to a 10.7m building line along the north side of Lancaster Road and a 7.6m building line along the south side of Lancaster Road, as measured from the back of the public footpath. No buildings or other structures are to be erected in excess of 1m in height in front of these building lines, although the area may be surfaced and used for parking/circulation space or be landscaped.

Video Chat App,Technology & Programming,Expert ($$$),Mobile App Development,GBP,35.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-01-23 02:54:50,"Reposted with more strict requirements for applications. Last post received too many low quality submissions.

I need a programmer who is experienced in the development of video chatting app that will connect people randomly and/or based on interests. Both text chat and video chat.

I am an IT engineer so I know some stuff about app development, but I am not a developer and am not an expert. 

Initial version will be a proof of concept that will only randomly connect people with an option for registration. During this phase graphics, branding, colouring will be nailed down along with minimum functionality. Consider this phase a trial that, if the result is good enough, will result in a permanent arrangement.

Later the app will feature paid subscription functions, and should be able to securely hold client details. It should also allow automated card payments via Stripe or similar. It will also feature SMS activation for new user accounts and CAPTCHA to weed out bots.

Later revisions will begin to include social elements such as friending/messaging/following. Videos will also later be scanned for inappropriate/illegal content with users facing a resulting ban.

The UI should be vibrant, simple and streamlined to QUICKLY collect required details from the user, and then get them into the video chat as quickly as possible. It should be enjoyable to use, with effects such as moving graphical backgrounds, fades, and such.

The 'fun' element of the graphical user experience is of high importance. See: Every other social/chat/dating app ever made for examples. It should be slick, professional and not look or feel cheap/glitchy. 

I would like to see the following from interested parties:
- Examples of your past GUI/UX work, vibrantly branded and enjoyable/exciting to use. Examples of the animations and smooth transition between screens would also be desirable.
- What you would recommend to hold client details. Integrate with an existing CRM, or build something custom? Indicate why. Security is of paramount of importance.
- To work on Android/Apple/Web, whether you would use multiple native apps, or a hybrid app. The user experience must not simply be a responsive webpage cheaply wrapped in an app. It should feel native with little/no latency and smooth animations between screens. How would you achieve this? I have heard of Flutter as a potential modern solution to the native vs. hybrid problem. Would you use this, or a different method? Explain why.
- Examples of animated transitions between screens, seamless integration with branding and colouring across all screens.
- App logos. I want you to design the branding as well as develop the app. Show me your past work.

I have put £30 per hour as the rate, however the budget and spend will ultimately depend on the quality of the developer's past work.

I would like to NOT see the following from interested parties:
- A list of URLS to the Play Store or Apple store showing your work. Use attachments.
- Irrelevant examples. Book keeping apps, maps, project management... these are entirely irrelevant.
- 1000 words about you/your company. I do not care. Show me your work.
- Assuring me you are the best person. Everyone says this.
- A generic copy and paste.",,2017-06-04,Edinburgh,United Kingdom,GBP,Technical Consultant

I have 4 joomla sites which need to be housed on my godaddy package.  The previous host has sent me links with the files zipped together.

They've said it's a five minute job to replace each on GoDaddy and I could probably do it myself, but I'd rather trust a pro!

In addition to moving them I need to make a few minor tweaks - just removing the odd picture, hiding one page.

But I also wanted to check sign up boxes (to MailChimp) and the boxes for finance payments/and form applications to make sure they're working properly.

could you kindly quote me?

here are the sites:

Just a brief outline of the situation: 

1. I had an existing Adsense account.

2. I opened a youtube channel for a friend and it automatically connected to that Adsense account (as I am new to 
youtube and Adsense I did not know how it worked properly).

3. I went through all of the steps and got the account verified. 

4. As the Adsense account was in my name so I had to put my own personal Tax information to the Adsense account. 

5. All was going well and we were views and getting paid, but the owner of the channel wanted to put the Adsense account in their name. 

6. Not knowing the consequences, I created an Adsense account under their name and tried to connect it to the 
Youtube Monetisation part. 

7. Youtube rejected the application stating: ""Thank you for your interest in AdSense. After reviewing your application, our specialists have found that it does not meet our programme criteria. Therefore, we are unable to accept you into our programme. Our AdSense programme policies are designed to ensure the effectiveness of Google ads for our publishers as well as for our advertisers. We review all publishers and we reserve the right to decline any application. If you are able to make changes to meet our programme criteria, you may reapply for AdSense in the future. Please note that we may not be able to respond to enquiries regarding the specific reasons for our decision. Thank you for your understanding. Thanks, The Google AdSense Team""

It's not really an explanation of why it was rejected. 

8. The option to update, or fix anything on the channel has been restricted it is making us wait 32 days. (see attached image)

The project is concluding next week and our link person the facilitator from Campus Radio has gone awol.

We urgently need someone first thing Monday morning to get on the telephone to the six radio stations and discover:

a) who the students / volunteers for each project with each radio station are / were.
b) contact details for any of these - especially phone numbers
c) where they have got to with their project in each case (to make 7 minute radio dramas from a choice of scripts)?

The important things are a and b) . If we can make contact with the student / volunteer groups themselves on Monday we can probably take things forward from there. (Our mission is to get the plays finished by the end of the week and see if a representative from any of the groups would like to come to the whole project convention in Albanian next weekend!

Skills

a) Comfortable with French (University +/ native speaker) as persuading University societies to give up information is going to be needed.
  
b) Real persistence and doggedness as important as anything - this is NOT a situation for someone to say ""well its just a voice mail so I sent them an email"" - its going to be about finding clever ways to contact hte university, its student radio organisation and the collection of students involved.

A sheet is attached of the 6 relevant stations and the contact details we have. All of them were working with Elodie Hervier - the facilitator who has gone completely awol. Also we have the contact details for the central organisation Campus Radio as well.

We are proposing to pay £25 per successful contact with an actual student / volunteer from each group - so that is up to £150 which might take a morning or two mornings.

Business Plan to establish a Finance  Company in Nigeria  ,Business,Expert ($$$),Consulting,GBP,75.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-01-20 13:31:00,"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a significant role in the development of the economy of many countries. According to the World Bank1, MSMEs represent about 90% of businesses worldwide. The growth of MSMEs in many countries, however, is often stifled by limited access to finance, as financial institutions are less likely to provide funding to MSMEs due to the high-risk nature of their businesses.

In Nigeria, the finance company licence was established by the Central Bank of Nigeria (""CBN"") to focus on meeting the financial needs of MSMEs. The CBN regulates finance companies through its Revised Guidelines for Finance Companies in Nigeria (the ""Guidelines"") issued in 2014.

A finance company is a company licensed by the CBN to provide financial services to individual consumers, and industrial, commercial or agricultural enterprises. These services include providing consumer loans, funds management, asset finance, project finance, local and international trade finance, debt factoring, debt securitization, debt administration, financial consultancy, loan syndication, warehouse receipt finance, covered bonds and issuing vouchers, coupons, cards and token stamps.

Hi,

Please refer this project--
 Grammarly API at https://developer.grammarly.com/

You have to use this API to feed in a folder containing PDF Files as input, and the Grammarly API will paraphrase the text and return a number of equivalent PDF files which will be saved to disk.

ALso refer this URL--> https://inside-machinelearning.com/en/use-yolov7/
YOu have to modify it so that it accepts a list of images in a folder and saves the output as an XML file. It gives list of objects in an image (OBject recognition).

Finally 3rd task is new-- go to an API, take output XML of previous step as input, and get as output (a) Images only (b) Illustrations only.

ANd 4th task-> PDF of step 1 has tags like img1.png and so on, simply insert output of 3rd step, which is img1.png of pdf(all images in a PDF one by one)-> 2nd step gives text based on the image--> 3rd step gives new images based on text ie objects in original image--> now insert all new images at placeholders for various images in PDF file.

THe main tasks are already coded as explained above. You have to combine these into a single Python project.


Do let me know if you can do this work.

Short company video needed!,"Video, Photo & Image",Expert ($$$),Videography,USD,200.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-20 02:47:04,"Looking for someone to create two short videos for an upcoming conference in our company. 

1. First one: short (20-30s) motivational video with a bunch of concepts of how “Together We Create” (our theme for 2023) is the first three words of many different statements.  Here are some of thoughts:  
 
Our Vision Statement is “Creating a world where mental health is in reach for all.”  
 
“Together We Create”  
 
Together – keeps the element of teamwork and alignment.

We – non-descript as to who this is which is intentional.  Is it the US and Israel? Sales and Marketing? BrainsWay and our customer partners (doctors) ? Individuals aligned on a share mission and vision? Yes.  All of the above. (And there is a capital “W”…)

Create – this is the first word of our vision.  It is a powerful word.  It means to make something that was not there before.  New opportunity? Aligned teams? Successful Customers? Efficiency? Momentum? Progress? Hope?  Once again, all of the above.  
 
I could see this as a short video of these words at the end of “Together We Create” to make complete sentences…something showing a cycle of these phrases to show the versatility.  Maybe using the photos of the teams all gathered or opening new clinics.  End with adding the “Together We” to the front of the vision statement.  
 
Our values of Teamwork, Optimism, Creativity all play into this. 
 
Photos and logos will be provided. (can use them with combination of stock images if needed)Please, send your quotes and timelines. Again, it should be a short but sweet 20-30s video. Thank you!

2. 10-15sec video/animated photos of all employees together showcased in a creative ways. Submit your ideas!

• DRAKENSBERG MOUNTAIN
The Drakensberg Mountain is the largest mountain on the Get a Bear Island. It is located on the Dragon Isles at the upper right side of the Get a Bear Island; by the right ear of the Bear. The mountain is inhabited by lots of mountain goats, who are the fastest animals on the Island; snakes can also be found on the mountain. The dragons sometimes eat the goats when they are unsuspecting but if there not fast the goats immediately run far away. A mysterious thing about the Drakensberg Mountain is that; the right side of the mountain is always dark. The sun never seems to be able to penetrate into that side, no matter how brightly it shines. The light always stops short of the farther right side of the mountain. Many have been too frightened to explore it and it has been told that those who did never returned.

• THE GULF OF DRAGONS ISLES
The Gulf of the Dragon Isles is located at the top right corner of the Get a Bear Island Map; beneath the Dragon Isles. The gulf is home to hundreds of fish. Sometimes, you can see a dragon diving in to the water to swoop up a fish or two that comes close to the surface. So, if you ever wish to sail through the gulf, make sure that you cover your raft with branches and move slowly so that they think that it is only a piece of wood floating by to avoid drawing the dragons’ attention. You also have to hang on tight to the boat because of the rough waters that can occur and rocks that could break the boat in a second. The water temperature is usually very low so it is mostly freezing cold; this is because of the current pulling water in from the Blizzard Plains.

• DRAGON ISLES
The Dragon Isles is located towards the upper right side of the Get a Bear Island; by the right ear of the Bear. The island is the origin of one of the creatures; whose statue is in the Land Of Honour. He is the Dragon Chief who rules the Draconic Clan. The weather in the Dragon Isles is mostly windy, whether it is night or day. The Dragon Isles has a very large mountain on it. The mountain is the largest structure on the Get a Bear Island. The mountain is called Drakensberg and it is the pride of the Dragon Isles. When men used to hunt dragons, it caused all the dragons to flee to the Drakensberg Mountain to hide; so, whenever rain falls, it rarely reaches the ground because of all the giant dragons there.",,2017-11-27,Glasgow,United Kingdom,GBP,

We have that many models for all mobile phone manufacturers, that we don't want to be shown like the example above, but only the matching products under that Brand should be shown.

For instance - if For Apple is selected, only iPhone & iPad models should show, no Samsung, no Huawei etc etc.

We do have the Metafields in place for the filters as you can see in the images attached.
We also have Product Tags which could help assist with the implementation.
